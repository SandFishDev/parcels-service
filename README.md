The current implementation covers Feature 1 (arguably a bit more than that :P )
This will be pushed to a separate branch (assignment-1, assignment-2). Any improvements in the future will not be
retroactively added to these branches.

# Changes for Feature 2

1. Add strategy for new department
2. Add priority to each strategy to decide order of operations
3. Add self referencing many-to-many departent relation to map relations between departments
4. When processing a parcel find a successor match and assign the parcel to that instead of finishing the process
